# mintain
Small bash script for linux maintenance.

Commands: update, upgrade, dist-upgrade, update-grub, autoremove, autoclean, empty-trash, and clean.

'dist-upgrade' will prompt (y/n) as some users prefer to run this command separately.  
Choosing 'n' (no) will simply skip over this command and continue with rest of program.  

Added: -option to update again, IF upgrades were available (prompts)  
        -timer
