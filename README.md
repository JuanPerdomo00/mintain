# mintain
Small bash script for linux maintenance  

Enables linux users to do basic maintenance all at once, quickly and easily.

Commands include: update, upgrade, dist-upgrade, update-grub, autoremove, autoclean, and clean.

'dist-upgrade' will prompt (y/n) as some users prefer to run this command separately.  
Choosing 'n' (no) will simply skip over this command and continue with rest of program.  

Added:  
  * Option to update again, 'IF' upgrades were available (prompts)  
  * Timer

   Update: Removed 'trash-empty' command as it only works with 'trash-cli' installed.
