# mintain
Small bash script for linux maintenance.

Commands: update, upgrade, dist-upgrade, update-grub, autoremove, autoclean, empty-trash, and clean.

'dist-upgrade' will prompt user (y/n) as some users prefer to run this command separately.
Choosing 'n' (no) will simply skip over this command and continue with rest of program.
