# mintain
Small bash script for linux maintenance.

Updates, upgrades, and cleans up after.

Just to be clear, 
Command 3 'dist-upgrade' will prompt user (y/n) as some users prefer to run this command separately.
Choosing 'n' (no) will simply skip over this command and continue with rest of program.
